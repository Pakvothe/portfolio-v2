    description:
      "Baldr is a secondary project within Belo, designed as an internal compliance management dashboard. It enables compliance analysts to efficiently handle requests and manage supporting documentation for fund verification through an intuitive interface. I was involved in this project from the very beginning, taking part in key decisions such as technology stack selection (Vite, React, TypeScript, MobX) and product design. I also contributed to defining features and workflows to ensure the dashboard met the needs of the compliance team. In addition to shaping the product vision, I implemented the entire frontend, focusing on performance, usability, and scalability. Baldr reflects a blend of thoughtful design, robust technical implementation, and a clear focus on solving complex compliance challenges within Belo.",
